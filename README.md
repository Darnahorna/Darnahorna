My name is Daria Nahorna ðŸ¦‹ A passion of mine is site construction and solving problems through frontend development, primarily on Javascript and React JS âœ¨

My experience in startup has helped to build a business developer mindset. I am creative, detail-oriented and always want to learn something new. Above all, I love building relationships with people. I believe this is necessary aspect of being a good team player.

In my free time I enjoy learning Swedish, scouting, hiking.

My life motto is 'Keep calm and study' ðŸ¤“.
